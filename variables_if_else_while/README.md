This directory will document initial progress in the tasks noted herein that involve handling variables if else and while to show the learning of C programming language.
This current push includes a readily available C code with an enhancement produced duing the exercise that serves for determining whether the number stored in given variable is negative or positive and has a script that assigns a random number to the variable each time it is executed.
This current push includes a readily available C code that assigns a random number to the variable n upon execution and finally prints the assigned number produced during each time it is executed with a code enhancement produced during the exercise.
This current push is a program for printing out the alphabet in lowercase followed by a new line.
This current push is a program that first prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase followed by a new line.
This current push is a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase with specifications related to the option putchar and not printing letters q and e following the alphabet with a new line.
This current push is a program that writes all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from zero followed by a new line.
This current push is a program that prints all single numbers of base ten starting from zero followed by a new line without the use of char type variable and with only the use of function putchar up to twice during the script.
This current push prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse followed by a new line with the exclussive use of function putchar up to twice during the script.
